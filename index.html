                            <p>I've been searching for an IT job since getting my associate's degree last year. It's been a tough battle- I'm still fighting it. I know I graduated during a perfect storm of AI adoption and economic uncertainty. Still, the applications are flowing! I needed a break from customizing resumes and writing cover letters, so It's time to work on the website. 
                            
                            Today I'm focusing on redesigning the look and feel of the site so that I can work off a solid foundation. I have a few more plans to imcorporate some things, one of which is very exciting to me personally. Did you know you can make music by coding? Stay tuned for more.</p>
