                            <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                            <p>I'm candlehand. You can call me candle, or Chip. I've worn a lot of hats in my life. I love music, art, science, and exploring what it means to be alive.</p> 
                            <h3>Where did 'candlehand' come from?</h3>
                            <p>The name originally comes from an old surrealist comedy sketch from the early years of the internet. I liked that it was two words without any complications or extra numbers. These days, the name serves as a personal reminder of one of my favorite books: Carl Sagan's "The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark." In the words of Lee Dembart's, review of the book, "a manifesto for clear thought".</p> 
                            <h3>What is the point of this website?</h3>
                            <p>Mostly, I wanted to put something out into the world. Not for profit or even to attract viewers, but for the joy of creating something.</p>
