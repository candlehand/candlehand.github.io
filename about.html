                <h3>Who are you?</h3>
                <p>Hi! I'm candlehand. I've worn a lot of hats in my life. I love music, art, science, and exploring what it means to be alive.</p>
                <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>
                <p>The web isn't what it used to be. It's become a gladiatorial arena for moneyed interests and corporate powers to do battle for our attention. But I remember a different time... a time when the web was made up of sites created by passionate humans. Many of these sites were created without a goal of monetary gain- just an urge to create art and share in a human experience. If I didn't grow up in the era of the Web 1.0, amongst geocities websites and dedicated fan forums, I don't think I would be here making websites today. This website is my love letter to human creativity.</p>
